I am a research professional specialist working with Bess Ward in the Geosciences department of Princeton University. I also contribute to project with Zoe Cardon at the Marine Biological laboratoy in Woods Hole, MA. I received my PhD in 2021 from Northeastern where I published a dissertation titled Nutrient Influence on microbial structure and function within salt marsh sediments[https://web.archive.org/web/20220825211317id_/https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:4f16j6858/fulltext.pdf]. 

Over the last two years, I have been studying and analyzing coastal phytoplankton ecology and oceanography and applying new approaches to reconstruct eukaryotic draft genomes, their viruses, and microbes living in the phycosphere. A mesocosm experiment, simulating a diatom bloom has been the focus of my research for nearly the last two years. I sequenced the 18S rRNA gene from longitudinal samples and integrated these data with microscopy, nutrient, and pigments to provide a holistic characterization of the bloom. The goal of this study was to identify potential parasitic interactions that could be important to understanding bloom dynamics. We found many interesting patterns in these data including widespread intragenus opposing relative abundance patterns (thats a lot of fancy words to say that ASVs with the same taxonomic classification at the genus level had opposite relative abundance patterns over time). We also identified large collecions of co occurring diatoms, dinoflagellates, and potential parasitic fungi and Syndiniales. Read more about that here []. My next project will include the role of bacteria and viruses in this complex bloom.
