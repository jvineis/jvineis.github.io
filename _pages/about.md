I am a scientific informatics project leader working with [Zoe Cardon](https://www.cardonlab.com/) in the Ecosystems Center of the Marine Biological laboratory. I received my PhD in 2021 from Northeastern where I published a dissertation titled [Nutrient Influence on microbial structure and function within salt marsh sediments](https://web.archive.org/web/20220825211317id_/https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:4f16j6858/fulltext.pdf). After completing my PhD, I spent two years in Bess Ward's lab at Princeton University within the Geosciences department where I published a paper about the diversity and niche specialization of diatoms and dinoflagellates within a simulated upwelling mesocosm experiment. My current interests in the Cardon lab are methane cycling among diverse methanogen and methanotrophic microbes witih a brackish marsh inhabited by Typha angustifolia. There are fascinating interactions between plants and microbes within this dynamic system. I am using omics techniques and hoping to begin cultivation of some important members of the community in order to pinpoint physiological resoponses to plant inputs and understand the interconnected nature of microbes and plants inhabiting the sediment.
