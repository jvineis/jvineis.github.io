To add publications to the site, I used a script that will create the markdown files which I uploaded to the _publications directory. I also had to uplod the pdfs to the files directory. I have included the python script used to create the md files which I you can run on the list of references that I downloaded from google scholar. I removed unnecessary fields from the table. You can see the fields that I kept in the file contained in this git called All-citations.csv. Just run the script like this

    python create-publications-file-for-git-pages.py All-citations.csv

This will create an md file for each of the file names contained in the All-citations.csv file. Each of these can be uploaded to the _publications directory and you will need to upload a pdf of and be sure that its named exactly as a the title
